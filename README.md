This repository contains a fully functional E-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend, and PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP for the backend. The site allows users to browse products, add items to their shopping cart, and manage their accounts through a secure sign-up and login system. The password protection is enhanced using hash key encryption, ensuring user data security. All server-side operations, including user authentication and cart management, are handled through PHP and MySQL, with XAMPP providing a local development environment. The design is responsive and user-friendly, offering seamless product browsing and real-time cart updates. Additionally, the project can be extended to include an admin interface for managing products and users.
